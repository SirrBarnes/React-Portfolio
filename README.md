# React-Portfolio

## Description

The application that you built for this module will help you know where to start when building your portfolio. Youâ€™ll use Create Vite just as you did with your module project, but you should be aware of a few structural differences in the component hierarchy. Your portfolio should include the following:

- A single Header component that appears on multiple pages

- A single Navigation component within the header that will be used to render the different sections of your portfolio

- A single Project component that will be used multiple times in the Portfolio section

- A single Footer component that appears on multiple pages


## Installation

To install simply download from the github repository, open a terminal at the root of the file structure, run "npm i" and then "npm run start". The application should open up at "localhost: 3000"
